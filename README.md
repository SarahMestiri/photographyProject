# photographyProject

Introduction:

The aim of this project is to build a web application offering for users a platform to put their photos and then make a selection for them according to the theme for example outdoor photos, indoor photos, friends photos, family photos. The selection should be done automatically through a learning algorithm that uses different features, old photos and tags in order to identify new photos context. After selection those photos will be placed in folders according to their contexts. That will be the first part of the project.

Goal:
Facilitate managing photos and no need to organize them manually because that takes time and sometimes someone forgets photos' location.
